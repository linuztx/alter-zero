# typing stays responsive. The event loop drains every buffered key
# before redrawing, so a burst of input renders in ONE repaint, not one per key.
# A 1000-char burst (ending in a unique marker) must therefore show up almost at
# once: before the coalescing fix it took ~0.9s (O(n²) — a full redraw per key),
# after it is a single redraw (~10ms). Assert the marker lands well inside that
# gap. (Kept under tmux's 1024-char single-burst cap so it's delivered at once.)
